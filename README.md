Introduction
------------

Robots are becoming more and more common in our daily lives showing up in
the form of everything from children's toys, to robotic vacuum cleaners, to home
security robots; robots have been doing automated tasks in factories for decades.
With the ever-increasing speed and power of digital systems coupled with the con-
tinuously expanding field of robotics, it is becoming more practical to build custom
robotic systems with a degree of 
exibility and freedom that was once impossible,
giving robots the ability to communicate wirelessly or to act autonomously.
All researchers are also interested in robots as a way to understand human
(and not just human) intelligence in its primary function - interacting with the
real world. Due to the wide and advanced applications of robotics, we planned to
do our project in robotics field.
